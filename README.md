# Apenox-s-Shop-Project
My midterm project for HackerU
In this project i have made a site for my brother dor (A.K.A Apenox). The site is used to present templates for his works which are Artworks, Logos, Workshops. I have been working on this site since March and about 100 hours, unfortunatly i havent had enough time to completely finish it. 

As you enter the site you are required to log in into your account, there are two options to log in as, as a user, and as an admin.

After you log in into the site you will remain in the site untill you log out, Thanks to local storage, afterwards, you will be directed into the Home page, which there you can see a welcoming note and a little about the site itself.Underneath, you can see a footer to the site, the first sections gives an information about the shop (such as: Phone number to contact, and location), the second section is a little navigation targets to all the pages that has information about the site, and the last section, directs you to all the types of the products mentioned in the site. Top right of the site, you get the option to log out of the user. Above, you can see the navigation bar, which lets you direct to other sides of the site:

Home (which was just mentioned)

Shop Page - A place where you can see 3 diffrent template arts, which are: Artworks, Logos, and Workshops. underneath every template you can see the name of the type, and a price matched to it. under the description, you have the option to add this specific item to the cart. In addition, once the user clicks at one of the arts that he chooses, An information tab is opened and the user can get more information about the next steps after choosing the art. in the right side of the shop page, a search bar is appeared, there you can search for products manually and once you click at one of the products the same information tab opens.

Contact Us Page - This page gives the user the option to contact the administrators of the site to recieve further support. its all done via an email adress.

About Page - The about page tells the user about the page, the owner, the person that created the site and a little more background about the site. In addition, a little persuasion to buy one of the products. 

Shopping Cart Page - this page communicates with the shop page. As mentioned above, underneath every showcase, theres an option to add the items to cart, after doing so, the items will remain in your cart untill you remove them, even if you exit the site and re-enter it. (Thanks to local storage), Once you're in the page, you can see the total cost of all your items and next to every products, you can either increase the quantity, or decrease it. Once you do, you get this little pop-up message to let you know the increase/ decrease was done successfuly. (same goes to "Add To Cart" option in the shop page). Eventually you get the option to Checkout.

User Orders Page (Admin view) - Unfortunatly, i havent had time to finish it, but what i will accomplish is once the user checks out the items in the shopping cart, the same items will be shown in the User orders page, in the page the administrator can see everyone's orders.

My Orders Page (User view) -  This page is a little bit more private to the user that is currently logged. Once the user completes a purchase, the item will be shown in the My orders page.

Honorable mentions: i still havent completely finished the project, but as results for my first project and after a long and hard time building it, i am satisfied with the current results.
